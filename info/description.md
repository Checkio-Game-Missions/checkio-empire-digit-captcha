The Robots use monospaced fonts with low resolution.
You can see the font on the picture below. This font has noise immunity to one-pixel error.

Your program should read the number shown in an image encoded as a binary matrix.
Each digit can contain a wrong pixel, but no more than one for each digit.
The space between digits is equal to one pixel (just think about "1" which is narrower than other letters, 
but has a width of 3 pixels).
